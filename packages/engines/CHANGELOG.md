# @embedpdf/engines

## 2.4.1

### Patch Changes

- [#434](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/434) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Fixed memory leak where image encoder workers were never terminated when the engine was destroyed:
  - Added optional `destroy()` method to `ImageDataConverter` interface for resource cleanup
  - Updated `createWorkerPoolImageConverter` and `createHybridImageConverter` to attach `destroy()` that terminates the encoder worker pool
  - Updated `PdfEngine.destroy()` to call `imageConverter.destroy?.()` to clean up encoder workers

  Previously, each viewer instance would leave 2 encoder workers running after destruction.

## 2.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#426](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/426) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Added redaction annotation engine methods:
  - Added `applyRedaction()` to apply a single REDACT annotation, removing content and flattening the overlay
  - Added `applyAllRedactions()` to apply all REDACT annotations on a page
  - Added `flattenAnnotation()` to flatten any annotation's appearance to page content
  - Added `readPdfRedactAnno()` for reading REDACT annotations with all properties
  - Added `addRedactContent()` for creating REDACT annotations with QuadPoints, colors, and overlay text
  - Added overlay text getter/setter methods for REDACT annotations

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#303](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/303) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – # Major Engine Architecture Refactor: Orchestrator Layer & Image Encoding Pool

  This release introduces a significant architectural improvement to the PDF engine system, separating concerns between execution and orchestration while adding parallel image encoding capabilities.

  ## Breaking Changes

  ### Engine Class Renamed
  - `PdfiumEngine` → `PdfiumNative` (the "dumb" executor)
  - New `PdfEngine` class wraps executors with orchestration logic
  - Factory functions (`createPdfiumEngine`) now return the orchestrated `PdfEngine<Blob>` wrapper

  **Migration:**

  ```typescript
  // Before
  import { PdfiumEngine } from '@embedpdf/engines';
  const engine = new PdfiumEngine(wasmModule, { logger });

  // After
  import { createPdfiumEngine } from '@embedpdf/engines/pdfium-worker-engine';
  // or
  import { createPdfiumEngine } from '@embedpdf/engines/pdfium-direct-engine';

  const engine = await createPdfiumEngine('/wasm/pdfium.wasm', {
    logger,
    encoderPoolSize: 2, // Optional: parallel image encoding
  });
  ```

  ### Rendering Methods Changed
  - `renderPage()` → Returns final encoded result (Blob) via orchestrator
  - `renderPageRaw()` → New method, returns raw `ImageData` from executor
  - `renderThumbnail()` → `renderThumbnailRaw()` for raw data
  - `renderPageAnnotation()` → `renderPageAnnotationRaw()` for raw data

  ### Search API Simplified
  - `searchAllPages()` → Now orchestrated at the `PdfEngine` level
  - `searchInPage()` → New single-page search method in executor
  - Progress tracking improved with proper `CompoundTask` support

  ### Document Loading Changes
  - Removed `openDocumentFromLoader()` - range request loading removed from executor
  - Removed `openDocumentUrl()` - URL fetching now handled in orchestrator
  - `openDocumentBuffer()` remains as the primary method in executor

  ## New Features

  ### 1. Orchestrator Architecture

  New three-layer architecture:
  - **Executor Layer** (`PdfiumNative`, `RemoteExecutor`): "Dumb" workers that execute PDF operations
  - **Orchestrator Layer** (`PdfEngine`): "Smart" coordinator with priority queues and scheduling
  - **Worker Pool** (`ImageEncoderWorkerPool`): Parallel image encoding

  Benefits:
  - Priority-based task scheduling
  - Visibility-aware rendering (viewport-based prioritization)
  - Parallel image encoding (non-blocking)
  - Automatic task cancellation and cleanup

  ### 2. Image Encoder Worker Pool

  ```typescript
  const engine = await createPdfiumEngine('/wasm/pdfium.wasm', {
    encoderPoolSize: 2, // Creates 2 encoder workers
  });
  ```

  - Offloads `OffscreenCanvas.convertToBlob()` from main PDFium worker
  - Prevents blocking during image encoding
  - Configurable pool size (default: 2 workers)
  - Automatic load balancing

  ### 3. Task Queue System

  New `WorkerTaskQueue` with:
  - Priority levels: `CRITICAL`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`
  - Visibility-based ranking for render tasks
  - Automatic task deduplication
  - Graceful cancellation

  ### 4. CompoundTask for Multi-Page Operations

  New `CompoundTask` class for aggregating results:

  ```typescript
  // Automatic progress tracking
  const task = engine.searchAllPages(doc, 'keyword');
  task.onProgress((progress) => {
    console.log(`Page ${progress.page} complete`);
  });
  ```

  - `CompoundTask.gather()` - Like `Promise.all()` with progress
  - `CompoundTask.gatherIndexed()` - Returns `Record<number, Result>`
  - `CompoundTask.first()` - Like `Promise.race()`
  - Automatic child task cleanup

  ## API Additions

  ### Models Package
  - `CompoundTask` - Multi-task aggregation with progress
  - `ImageConversionTypes` type refinements
  - `PdfAnnotationsProgress.result` (renamed from `annotations`)

  ### Engines Package

  New exports:
  - `PdfEngine` - Main orchestrator class
  - `RemoteExecutor` - Worker communication proxy
  - `ImageEncoderWorkerPool` - Image encoding pool
  - `WorkerTaskQueue` - Priority-based queue
  - `PdfiumNative` - Renamed from `PdfiumEngine`

  New image converters:
  - `browserImageDataToBlobConverter` - Legacy converter
  - `createWorkerPoolImageConverter()` - Pool-based converter
  - `createHybridImageConverter()` - Fallback support

  ### Plugin-Render Package

  New config options:

  ```typescript
  {
    render: {
      defaultImageType: 'image/webp',
      defaultImageQuality: 0.92
    }
  }
  ```

  ## Improvements
  - **Performance**: Parallel image encoding improves render throughput by ~40-60%
  - **Responsiveness**: Priority queues ensure visible pages render first
  - **Memory**: Better cleanup of completed tasks and worker references
  - **Logging**: Enhanced performance logging with duration tracking
  - **Developer Experience**: Clearer separation of concerns

- [#303](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/303) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – # Remove `initialize()` - PDFium Now Initializes in Constructor

  This release removes the `initialize()` method from all engine classes. PDFium is now automatically initialized in the constructor, simplifying the API and reducing boilerplate.

  ## Breaking Changes

  ### `initialize()` Method Removed

  The `initialize()` method has been removed from:
  - `PdfiumNative` (formerly `PdfiumEngine`)
  - `PdfEngine` orchestrator
  - `RemoteExecutor`
  - `WebWorkerEngine`
  - `IPdfiumExecutor` interface
  - `PdfEngine` interface (in models)

  **Migration:**

  ```typescript
  // Before
  const native = new PdfiumNative(wasmModule, { logger });
  native.initialize();

  const engine = new PdfEngine(native, { imageConverter, logger });
  engine.initialize();

  // After - no initialize() needed!
  const native = new PdfiumNative(wasmModule, { logger });
  const engine = new PdfEngine(native, { imageConverter, logger });

  // Ready to use immediately
  const doc = await engine.openDocumentBuffer(file).toPromise();
  ```

  ### Framework Hooks Simplified

  The `usePdfiumEngine` hooks (React, Vue, Svelte) no longer require calling `initialize()`:

  ```typescript
  // Before
  const { engine, isLoading } = usePdfiumEngine();
  const [initialized, setInitialized] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (engine && !initialized) {
      engine.initialize().wait(setInitialized, ignore);
    }
  }, [engine, initialized]);

  // After - engine is ready when returned!
  const { engine, isLoading } = usePdfiumEngine();

  if (!isLoading && engine) {
    // Ready to use immediately
  }
  ```

  ### `PluginRegistry.ensureEngineInitialized()` Removed

  The `ensureEngineInitialized()` method and `engineInitialized` property have been removed from `PluginRegistry` since engines are now initialized in their constructors.

  ## Cross-Platform Image Data

  ### `ImageData` → `ImageDataLike`

  The engine now returns `ImageDataLike` (a plain object with `data`, `width`, `height`) instead of the browser-specific `ImageData` class. This enables Node.js compatibility without polyfills.

  **Affected types:**
  - `PdfImageObject.imageData` now uses `ImageDataLike`
  - All raw render methods return `ImageDataLike`

  ### Browser Converter Fallback

  `browserImageDataToBlobConverter` now falls back to regular `<canvas>` when `OffscreenCanvas` is not available (older browsers). The hybrid converter (`createHybridImageConverter`) uses:
  1. Worker pool with `OffscreenCanvas` (preferred, non-blocking)
  2. Main-thread `<canvas>` fallback (blocking, but works everywhere)

  ## Benefits
  - **Simpler API**: One less step to get started
  - **Less boilerplate**: No more `initialize()` calls in every component
  - **Node.js compatible**: `ImageDataLike` works without browser APIs
  - **Broader browser support**: Canvas fallback for older browsers

### Minor Changes

- [#279](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/279) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – ## Multi-Document Support

  Updated engine internals to support multiple documents with improved memory management.

  ### Changes
  - **Memory Management**: Enhanced memory tracking through `MemoryManager` for proper cleanup of multiple document instances.
  - **Cache**: `PdfCache` now properly tracks and manages multiple document contexts with improved memory management through the memory manager.

  ### Technical Details
  - Document contexts now use `MemoryManager` for proper WASM pointer tracking and cleanup
  - Improved resource management for concurrent document handling

## 2.0.0-next.3

### Major Changes

- [`f13b2d4`](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/commit/f13b2d48eebd7b2f02e881fee80f68bf4219c1d6) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – # Major Engine Architecture Refactor: Orchestrator Layer & Image Encoding Pool

  });
  ```

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#238](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/238) by [@0xbe7a](https://github.com/0xbe7a) – Add optional **form widget rendering** to the render pipeline.

  ### What changed
  - **@embedpdf/models**
    - `PdfRenderPageOptions` now supports `withForms?: boolean` to request drawing interactive form widgets.

  - **@embedpdf/engines**
    - `PdfiumEngine.renderPage` and `renderPageRect` honor `withForms`.
      When enabled, the engine initializes the page form handle and calls `FPDF_FFLDraw` with the correct device transform.
    - New helper `computeFormDrawParams(matrix, rect, pageSize, rotation)` calculates start offsets and sizes for `FPDF_FFLDraw`.

  - **@embedpdf/plugin-render**
    - New plugin config flags:
      - `withForms?: boolean` (default `false`)
      - `withAnnotations?: boolean` (default `false`)
    - The plugin merges per-call options with plugin defaults so callers can set once at init or override per call.
