## 2.4.1

## 2.4.0

### Patch Changes

- [#426](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/426) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Fixed AutoMount component to render utilities inside wrapper context. Utilities registered via `addUtility()` now have access to context provided by wrappers (React, Vue, Svelte), enabling plugins to share context between wrappers and utilities.

## 2.3.0

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#389](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/389) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Add document permissions support:
  - Add `useDocumentPermissions` hook for React, Svelte, and Vue with reactive permission state and helper methods (`hasPermission`, `hasAllPermissions`, and shorthand booleans like `canPrint`, `canCopyContents`, etc.)
  - Add `UPDATE_DOCUMENT_SECURITY` action and `updateDocumentSecurity` action creator for updating document security state
  - Add reducer case for updating document permissions and owner unlock state
  - Add permission helper methods to `BasePlugin`: `getDocumentPermissions`, `checkPermission`, `requirePermission`
  - Export `useDocumentPermissions` from shared, svelte, and vue entry points

- [#389](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/389) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Add permission override system with global and per-document configuration:
  - Add `PermissionConfig` interface for configuring permission overrides with `enforceDocumentPermissions` and `overrides` options
  - Add `permissions` option to `PluginRegistryConfig` for global permission configuration
  - Add `permissions` to `DocumentState` for per-document permission overrides
  - Add `getEffectivePermission` and `getEffectivePermissions` selectors for layered permission resolution (per-document → global → PDF)
  - Add human-readable permission names (`print`, `modifyContents`, `copyContents`, etc.) as alternatives to numeric flags
  - Update `BasePlugin` permission helpers (`checkPermission`, `requirePermission`, `getDocumentPermissions`) to use effective permissions
  - Update `useDocumentPermissions` hooks (React, Svelte, Vue) to return both effective and raw PDF permissions
  - Add `config` prop to `EmbedPDF` components for passing `PluginRegistryConfig`, deprecating individual `logger` prop
  - Export `PermissionConfig`, `PermissionName`, `ALL_PERMISSION_FLAGS`, and permission selectors

### Major Changes

- [#279](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/279) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – ## Multi-Document Support

  This is a major refactoring to support multiple documents in a single viewer instance. The core architecture has been significantly enhanced to manage per-document state and lifecycle.

  ### Breaking Changes
  - **Store Structure**: Core state now uses `documents: Record<string, DocumentState>` instead of a single `document` property. Each document has its own state including pages, scale, rotation, and other document-specific properties.
  - **BasePlugin Lifecycle**: Added new protected lifecycle methods that plugins can override:
    - `onDocumentLoadingStarted(documentId: string)` - Called when a document starts loading
    - `onDocumentLoaded(documentId: string)` - Called when a document finishes loading
    - `onDocumentClosed(documentId: string)` - Called when a document is closed
    - `onActiveDocumentChanged(previousId: string | null, currentId: string | null)` - Called when the active document changes
    - `onScaleChanged(documentId: string, scale: number)` - Called when document scale changes
    - `onRotationChanged(documentId: string, rotation: number)` - Called when document rotation changes
  - **Document Access**: New helper methods in BasePlugin:
    - `getActiveDocumentId()` - Get the active document ID (throws if none)
    - `getActiveDocumentIdOrNull()` - Get the active document ID or null
    - `getCoreDocument(documentId?: string)` - Get document state by ID
    - `getCoreDocumentOrThrow(documentId?: string)` - Get document state or throw
  - **Actions**: All core actions now support an optional `documentId` parameter. Actions that previously operated on a single document now require explicit document targeting.
  - **State Management**: The store now tracks multiple documents with an `activeDocumentId` field to indicate which document is currently active.

  ### New Features
  - Support for opening and managing multiple PDF documents simultaneously
  - Per-document state isolation
  - Document lifecycle management with proper cleanup
  - Active document tracking and switching

### Minor Changes

- [#303](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/303) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – # Remove `initialize()` - PDFium Now Initializes in Constructor

  This release removes the `initialize()` method from all engine classes. PDFium is now automatically initialized in the constructor, simplifying the API and reducing boilerplate.

  ## Breaking Changes

  ### `initialize()` Method Removed

  The `initialize()` method has been removed from:
  - `PdfiumNative` (formerly `PdfiumEngine`)
  - `PdfEngine` orchestrator
  - `RemoteExecutor`
  - `WebWorkerEngine`
  - `IPdfiumExecutor` interface
  - `PdfEngine` interface (in models)

  **Migration:**

  ```typescript
  // Before
  const native = new PdfiumNative(wasmModule, { logger });
  native.initialize();

  const engine = new PdfEngine(native, { imageConverter, logger });
  engine.initialize();

  // After - no initialize() needed!
  const native = new PdfiumNative(wasmModule, { logger });
  const engine = new PdfEngine(native, { imageConverter, logger });

  // Ready to use immediately
  const doc = await engine.openDocumentBuffer(file).toPromise();
  ```

  ### Framework Hooks Simplified

  The `usePdfiumEngine` hooks (React, Vue, Svelte) no longer require calling `initialize()`:

  ```typescript
  // Before
  const { engine, isLoading } = usePdfiumEngine();
  const [initialized, setInitialized] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (engine && !initialized) {
      engine.initialize().wait(setInitialized, ignore);
    }
  }, [engine, initialized]);

  // After - engine is ready when returned!
  const { engine, isLoading } = usePdfiumEngine();

  if (!isLoading && engine) {
    // Ready to use immediately
  }
  ```

  ### `PluginRegistry.ensureEngineInitialized()` Removed

  The `ensureEngineInitialized()` method and `engineInitialized` property have been removed from `PluginRegistry` since engines are now initialized in their constructors.

  ## Cross-Platform Image Data

  ### `ImageData` → `ImageDataLike`

  The engine now returns `ImageDataLike` (a plain object with `data`, `width`, `height`) instead of the browser-specific `ImageData` class. This enables Node.js compatibility without polyfills.

  **Affected types:**
  - `PdfImageObject.imageData` now uses `ImageDataLike`
  - All raw render methods return `ImageDataLike`

  ### Browser Converter Fallback

  `browserImageDataToBlobConverter` now falls back to regular `<canvas>` when `OffscreenCanvas` is not available (older browsers). The hybrid converter (`createHybridImageConverter`) uses:
  1. Worker pool with `OffscreenCanvas` (preferred, non-blocking)
  2. Main-thread `<canvas>` fallback (blocking, but works everywhere)

  ## Benefits
  - **Simpler API**: One less step to get started
  - **Less boilerplate**: No more `initialize()` calls in every component
  - **Node.js compatible**: `ImageDataLike` works without browser APIs
  - **Broader browser support**: Canvas fallback for older browsers

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#222](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/222) by [@andrewrisse](https://github.com/andrewrisse) – feat: Add Svelte 5 adapter (`/svelte` export) with Rune-based hooks (`useRegistry`, `usePlugin`, `useCapability`, `useCoreState`) and components (`EmbedPDF`, `AutoMount`, `NestedWrapper`). Enhanced core `Store` to prevent dispatches within reducers. Thanks to @andrewrisse for the Svelte integration work!

- [#141](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/141) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Refactored action dispatch handling in `BasePlugin`:
  - Renamed `debouncedDispatch` to **`cooldownDispatch`**, which now executes immediately if the cooldown has expired and blocks rapid repeated calls.
  - Introduced a new **`debouncedDispatch`** method that provides true debouncing: waits until no calls occur for the specified time before dispatching.
  - Added **`cancelDebouncedDispatch`** to cancel pending debounced actions.
  - Added internal `debouncedTimeouts` tracking and ensured all timeouts are cleared on `destroy`.

  This improves clarity and provides both cooldown and debounce semantics for action dispatching.
